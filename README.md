# Python and SQL
How do Python and SQL interact. This is just a gathering of short pieces of code that show how we can use python to interact with SQL databases and modify and use the data on them more appropriately. Whether it's to get data sorted differently, create charts using SQL data or modifying an entire Database.

Thanks for checking it out.
